We used the recipe for the Blood Orange Hefeweizen from [_Extreme Brewing_](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=seatthomeb-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=1592532934) but instead of out-of-season blood oranges we used in-season heirloom navel oranges. We know that it won&#8217;t be much like the recipe, but it still sounds good.

The beer wasn&#8217;t fully carbonated when we first tasted it (see picture at top). That was after only about a week in the bottle, but once it did carbonate it was tasty.

##### Timeline

  * Brewed 
      * May 26, 2012
  * Transfered 
      * N/A
  * Bottled 
      * June 15, 2012
  * Tasted 
      * June 23, 2012 

  * For the Hallertau we substituted German Herbrucker hops, which are a spicier version of Hallertau.
  * No other substitutions noted (except for the oranges, of course).
  * We used a plastic fermentation bucket so that we didn&#8217;t have to worry about getting the orange pieces out of a carboy. Â   
    Good decision.
