The weather finally turned nice in Seattle and I hadn’t brewed anything yet in 2017, so I thought I’d take advantage of the 80+ degree weather for this long Memorial Day weekend and try brewing a Saison. I figured it will be nice to have on hand for the hot days ahead.

I’ve also been interested in making a Saison with [Wyeast 3711 (French Saison)](https://wyeastlab.com/yeast-strain/french-saison), which has a lower temperature range than Wyeast 3724. It was 3724 (Belgian Saison) that led to the infamous [Exploding Saison](/2011/06/10/ginger-saison-without-ginger-brewday/) disaster.

To make things interesting, I want to add peaches during fermentation, so this is going to be a Peach French Saison–Vive la Pêche.

## Recipe

I used up a bunch of old hops for this, so they weren&#8217;t as fresh as you&#8217;d hope. But the homebrew shop was out of the Styrian Golding hops that I had hoped to use.<section class="brewtable">

## Brewing Notes

  * Added 6 lbs of pureed peach (weighed after puree) to about half (2.5 gallons) of the saison. Aged for 9 days.
  * Blended 2 gallons of the peach saison (losing some to the puree) with 1 gallon of the un-peached saison. Bottled this 3 gallons, and then bottled another ~1 gallon of the remaining un-peached saison.
  * Overall, lost about a gallon to the puree (which was too small) and general yeastiness at the bottom of the carboys.<section class="brewtable">
