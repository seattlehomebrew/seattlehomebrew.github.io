We're brewing **four** batches to fill a [13.5 gallon Dry Fly Wheat Whiskey barrel](/category/the-story-of-barry/?order=ASC)! That should give us enough (~16 gallons or so) to fill the barrel and have extra to top off and maybe keep some as a control batch.

For our barrel project we decided on the recipe from [_The Homebrewer’s Recipe Guide_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684829215/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684829215&linkCode=as2&tag=seatthomeb-20&linkId=BFPVAFDIITPWS7ZF) that we used on [our first test batch](/2012/11/canadian-imperial-stout-brewday).

Four simultaneous brew stations! Offset by ~20 minutes each.

10 lbs of liquid malt extract for each batch! And of course we had a boil-over (but only one!).

We split the four batches across five carboys. Most were 5-gallon carboys, which didn't hold a full batch during primary fermentation of [our earlier test batch](/2012/11/canadian-imperial-stout-brewday/).

All tucked in for a good nights sleep? Not exactly. We probably should have known better than to use an airlock on such a big beer! Unfortunately, we were short one blowoff tube and had to get an emergency blowoff tube to avoid an overnight disaster.
