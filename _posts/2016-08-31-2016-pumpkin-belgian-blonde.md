For our annual pumpkin beer this year, we wanted to try something new. Jer found this article about [designing the perfect pumpkin beer](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/designing-perfect-pumpkin-beer-recipe/), and the mention of a Belgian pumpkin ale sparked our interest. Maybe we&#8217;ll get more pumpkin flavor with a lighter beer (compared to our usual [Punkin&#8217; Porter](/category/brews/punkin-porter/) recipe).

It&#8217;s not bad, but it&#8217;s not great. Much better than we expected when tasting the beer during bottling. It wasn&#8217;t fully carbonated when cracking open the first bottle after 12 days, but was on its way.

I think my favorite year so far has been the [2013 batch](http://seattlehomebrew.com/2013/09/14/2013-punkin-porter-brewday/).

**_Update:_** After another week or so the beer did get carbonated and is actually pretty good. It&#8217;s got **a lot of pumpkin flavor and a lot of spice**. Maybe too much squash flavor. I wouldn&#8217;t repeat this recipe exactly, but it&#8217;s much better than the brew notes (below) were predicting.

## Recipe

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_5319-001-700x500.jpg" class="aligncenter" /> 

We started with the clone recipe for the Double Enghien Blonde Ale in the [CloneBrews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160342539X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=160342539X&linkCode=as2&tag=seatthomeb-20&linkId=QJWZLEAN33BGBN5G) book. We made a few substitutions based on what was available, but nothing that should be a problem.<section class="brewtable">

      <strong>We changed our pumpkin strategy this year.</strong> For all of our previous pumpkin beers, we steeped the pumpkin purée along with crushed grain and removed it for the full boil.<br /> <br /> This year we added the pumpkin late, at 15 minutes as suggested in the <a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/designing-perfect-pumpkin-beer-recipe/">designing perfect pumpkin beer</a> article. This makes sense because that&#8217;s when you add the flavoring hops. We used five 15 oz cans of pumpkin purée (75 oz), which is about 4½ pounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No spices during brewing.</strong> Usually we add spices right near the end of brewing. Instead, we&#8217;re going off of one of the <a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/5-tips-brewing-pumpkin-beers-elysian-brewing-co/">tips on brewing pumpkin beer</a> from Elysian founder Dick Cantwell and head brewer Steve Luke, the kings of pumpkin beers.<br /> <br /> Our plan is to instead add the spices just before bottling, after tasting the beer and deciding on what combination of the &#8220;faithful 5&#8221; (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger and clove) will go well with this beer. We&#8217;ll find out if it&#8217;s ok to add the spices and bottle without letting it rest first.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>This might be terrible.</strong> It took us forever to schedule a day to bottle this beer and when we finally did, we were not happy with the flavor. Sour? Off flavors? Dirty squash aftertaste? So we didn&#8217;t care to try multiple spice combinations and just added ~1 teaspoon of each of the &#8220;faithful 5&#8221; spices, except for allspice (½ tsp) which we&#8217;ve found to be overpowering in the past.
