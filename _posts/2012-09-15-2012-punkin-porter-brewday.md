As usual, for 2012 we once again followed the <a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=seatthomeb-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=1592532934" target="_blank"><em>Extreme Brewing</em></a> recipe and made modifications to the pumpkin process.

The initial tasting was thick and chunky, but very nice on the pumpkin flavor. Spices seemed to be well-balanced.

**_Update:_** After a little time in the bottle, this batch got a real earthy flavor that was unpleasant. I&#8217;m guessing this was the pumpkin seeds but could have been any part of the fully roasted pumpkin. Maybe stick to the pumpkin flesh in the future.

  * **We tried roasting a real pumpkin**  
    We cut a small (3.25 pound) pumpkin into small slices and baked it for an hour at 350 degrees. We also baked the seeds at 350 degrees for about 10-12 minutes for extra roastiness. </p> 
    Both the pumpkin and seeds went into the pre-boil tea with the grains for about 45 minutes.</li> 
    
      * **We also used Libby&#8217;s canned pumpkin**  
        We used _59 ounces_&#8211;even more than last year&#8211;and put into a muslin bag and added to the standard wort boil at the 60 minute mark.
      * **We used less allspice again**  
        We used 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and 0.5 tsp of allspice. The 0.5 tsp of allspice is half of the 1 tsp in the directions. We liked how [last year&#8217;s batch](/2011/09/punkin-porter-brewday-2011/) tasted with a little less allspice and mainly wanted to increase the pumpkin flavor. We again used pre-ground/dried spices this time.
      * The starting volume was roughly 20 quarts (5 gallons) prior to adding any malt.
      * We actually followed the directions for the Cascade, the Hallertau, and the spices. No substitutions this year.
      * We added some extra plain water that was boiling on the stove near the end of the boil to raise the volume.
      * We ended at about 4.25-4.5 gallons.</ul>
