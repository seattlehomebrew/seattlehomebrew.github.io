This is our first test beer as a candidate for [barrel aging](/category/the-story-of-barry/?order=ASC). The recipe is from [_The Homebrewer’s Recipe Guide_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684829215/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684829215&linkCode=as2&tag=seatthomeb-20&linkId=BFPVAFDIITPWS7ZF). This is the first time we have used this recipe book.

##### Overview

  * Starting gravity (actual) 
      * **1.104!**
  * Starting gravity (expected) 
      * 1.079
  * Final gravity (actual) 
      * 1.031
  * Final gravity (expected) 
      * N/A
  * ABV 
      * ~9.7% 

It tastes real good and real boozy! 

**This might be my favorite beer that we've ever brewed.**

### Recipe

  * The book didn’t specify, so we used 10 pounds of _liquid_ malt extract. Otherwise no substitutions.
  * Because of the high expected original gravity we used two packages of the Irish Ale Yeast.

  * **It’s fermenting like crazy!**  
    Oh. My. God. We left it upstairs for warmer temperature. The carboy temperature reads at the highest 78 degrees (so maybe even higher?). By the morning the carboy had lost over a gallon of volume through the blowoff tube and caused the bucket of sanitized water to overflow. The level in the carboy continues to drop. We only have 5 gallon carboys, so there wasn’t much head space for the krausen.

  * **Three Different Bottlings**  
    When bottling, we did half with maple syrup (as the recipe suggested) and half with the standard corn sugar. We also filled a Woodinville Whiskey Co. mini-barrel to age separately.
