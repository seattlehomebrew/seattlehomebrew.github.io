This is our second test beer as a candidate for [barrel aging](/category/the-story-of-barry/?order=ASC). We followed the recipe from [BYO’s Belgian Abbey Style of the Month article](http://www.byo.com/stories/item/200-belgian-abbey-ale-style-of-the-month) (although the link is apparently dead). We also got a little help from our buddy Ty on this batch!

The first tasting of the Tipsy Trappist was disappointing and flat.

It&#8217;s terrible!

Merry Christmas

**Update:** Still bad after a few months. For what I think is the first time ever with a homebrew, I even poured out a few of the remaining bottles.

This recipe is a partial mash, which we’ve never done before but doesn’t seem too complicated: [Partial Mashing (BeerSmith)](http://beersmith.com/blog/2009/05/14/partial-mashing/). Maybe that was our downfall or we weren&#8217;t careful enough with keeping it clean.

We sparged for 90 minutes in 2 gallons of water at 155 degrees in a blue picnic cooler. Then added up to a total of 6 gallons to start the wort.

Oh, and it rained so we improvised some shelter.
