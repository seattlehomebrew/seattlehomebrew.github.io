This is a scotch ale and is our third test beer as a candidate for [barrel aging](/category/the-story-of-barry/?order=ASC). The recipe comes from [CloneBrews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160342539X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=160342539X&linkCode=as2&tag=seatthomeb-20&linkId=QJWZLEAN33BGBN5G).

I tasted this after a couple of weeks and it’s not great and pretty flat.

**Update:** After several weeks the carbonation improved and the flavor was much better!

### Brewing Notes

##### Timeline

  * Brewed 
      * December 15, 2012
  * Transferred 
      * N/A
  * Bottled 
      * January 5, 2013
  * Tasted (flat) 
      * January 18, 2013 

  * We skipped the dry hopping that the recipe called for. The recipe called for 0.5 oz Fuggles, which I can’t imagine would make a huge difference.
  * My notes say that we skipped the addition of 0.25 oz steamed/toasted oak chips, but I don&#8217;t actually see that in the recipe.  Although I&#8217;m looking at the old (original) version of the CloneBrews book so maybe it was added to the 2nd Edition.  Jer has a copy of the 2nd Edition so that&#8217;s probably where the note comes from.
