This is the real Hopfather recipe from Sam Calagione's [_Extreme Brewing_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592532934/ref=ss_til?tag=seatthomeb-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=&creativeASIN=1592532934) (see our [failed attempt here](/2011/04/30/the-hopfather-hop-slurry-brew-day)). We went back to trusty old extract brewing for this batch and it was _much_ easier and _much_ less stressful.

These amazing labels were made for us, thinking the name of the beer was "Hot Father" instead of "Hopfather"; At first taste, the beer is fantastic and hoppy but needs a little more time to carbonate.
