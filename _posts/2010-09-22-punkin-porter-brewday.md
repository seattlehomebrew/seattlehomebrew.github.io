In bullet hole form:

  * Used 2x 15oz cans of Libby&#8217;s pumpkin
  * Hallertau hops not available. We used Mt Hood instead.
  * Did not use cloth bag for grain. We just mixed pumpkin and grain to make pre-boil tea. Strained through strainer + cheesecloth and think we lost a lot of pumpkin &#8220;sludge&#8221;
  * Sparged the grain (+ pumpkin) and got out a lot more color (and, presumably, sugar)
  * Started a separate ~4 gallon water boil with the gypsum
  * Mixed pre-boil tea with gypsum water and topped off to 5.5 gal before malt addition. Recipe said to only top off to 4.5. Bad idea After adding malt, we are up to 6-7 gal. Boiled water for ~1 hour extra to get down to 5-5.5 gal before adding the hops
  * 2 boil overs 🙁
  * Added more water twice towards the end of the hop boil to get back up to ~5 gallons again, rather than adding water to carboy. Gravity too low afterwards.
  * Forgot to sterilize the yeast package.
  * Sad&#8211;the primary carboy is still under 5 gal
  * Siphon to secondary fermentation sucked: 
      * Lots of air bubbles in siphon
      * Only 4 gallons transferred including what looks like ~0.5 gallons of sediment
      * Left another ~0.5 gal of sediment remained in the primary carboy
