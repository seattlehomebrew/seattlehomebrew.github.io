This is our first brew from [_Brooklyn Brew Shop&#8217;s Beer Making Book_](http://amzn.to/1Tb4oFl). The book contains recipes for small 1&#8209;gallon batches, but does include changes for making a normal 5&#8209;gallon batch. 

This Grapefruit Honey Ale sounded terrific to have ready to drink in Spring and Summer.

### Results

##### Overview

  * Starting Gravity (actual) 
      * 1.065
  * Starting Gravity (expected) 
      * N/A
  * Final Gravity (actual) 
      * 1.014
  * Final Gravity (expected) 
      * N/A 

Being familiar with other brewing recipes, it was odd that this one didn&#8217;t include starting or final gravity numbers.  Maybe the target audience for 1-gallon batches doesn&#8217;t really care?  It&#8217;s just nice to have them as a rough guide.

When tasting the wort there was a noticable bitter grapefruit aftertaste (in a good way).

### Brewing Notes

##### Timeline

  * Brewed on 
      * April 18, 2012
  * Transferred on 
      * N/A
  * Bottled on 
      * May 12, 2012
  * Tasted on 
      * May 19, 2012 

  * This was a confusing book because the recipes are for 1-gallon batches with only a small sidebar for a normal 5-gallon batch.
  * We had to make many substitutions for available malts and to use up some hops that we already had on hand.
  * We used 5 &#8220;small&#8221; grapefruits (instead of the ridiculously large grapefruits). The recipe only calls for roasting their peels.
